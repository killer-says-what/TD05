Big cat (uh, oh)
Space Nazis, Robert Stack (uh, oh)
God damn it, gonna snap (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Leonard Nimoy, call me back (call me back)
I try to call you every day
I'm rehearsing what to say
When the truth comes out (of my very own mouth)
I've been working on a unified theory
If I make it through tonight everybody's gonna hear me out
'Cause I'm the right one
On my touch-tone, touch-tone telephone
I'm the only one
On your A.M., A.M. Radio
Oh, I'm crying now
Authentic tears
They flow out of me when I think about you
'Cause you're the only person in the world who'd understand
'Cause you're the only person in the world who'd understand the meaning of this
Oh, my God
I try and I try and I try (to make you listen to me)

CABINET MAN:

The day they found me, I hadn't yet been played
Inside my workshop behind the old arcade
Electric desires had unraveled all my wires
Now I'm in the box for safekeeping
The news reporters reported that I died
But all my organs were living on inside
Circuit board to brain with two lungs collecting change
One big human heart gently beeping
You can't win me, I can't be beat
I won't hurt you unless you cheat
You can't see me behind the screen
I'm half human and half machine
Thank God for business, they let me take the floor
I stood so proudly, like I was going to war
Players soon appeared and I quickly was revered
This must be what love would have felt like
Such dedication, they came from miles away
With eyes so piercing, they'd wait their turn to play
Perfect patient lines because I was in their minds
I could do whatever I felt like (whatever I felt like)
You can't win me, I can't be beat
I won't hurt you unless you cheat
You can't see me behind the screen
I'm half human and half machine
I'm happy for years and years
And, only eating the occasional maintenance man
Only driving a few kids to madness
Maybe they were predisposed to madness, who knows?
I only want to have fun
But now they're telling me my days here are done
'Cause there's a tiny little box that they make in Japan
And pretty soon it's gonna fit in your hand
It's getting lonely, it's getting hard to breathe
The arcade's empty, I think it's Christmas Eve
Someone's broken in, now they're painting on my skin
Breaking me and taking my quarters
Bashing in my face with a crowbar
Kicking me and pushing me over
Now they see my blood on their sneakers
You can't win me, I can't be beat
I won't hurt you unless you cheat
You can't see me behind the screen
I'm half human and half machine

NO EYED GIRL:

Oh, knowing what we know, knowing what we don't know
This is gonna change our world
Feeling how I feel, I'll accept the unreal
If you'd be my no-eyed girl
From nowhere mankind can go
There's too much light, blinding white
Your matter tells mine to scatter
It's alright, it's alright
From the moment that we met
I've been awake like I've never been awake in all my life
If I spoke your language, I could tell you how I feel
But your language isn't real
In every myth, there's a little bit of truth
But I cannot say a thing
I cannot say a thing
Without proof, oh, no
Knowing what we know, knowing what we do not know
This is gonna change our world
I might go insane if I learn your full name
If you'd be my no-eyed girl
From nowhere mankind can go
There's too much light, blinding white
Emotions, human implosions
It's alright, it's alright
Right before the kiss, I noticed something in the air
Molecules existed when there should have been none there
Chemical reactions with the surface of your skin
Some will say my actions let the no-eyed people in
And I'd do it all again
And I'd do it all again
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
And I'd do it all again
And I'd do it all again
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

WHEN HE DIED:

When he died
Turns out he left behind
A mansion full of other people's skulls
The odd thing is, they never found his own when he died
When he died
He somehow left behind
Strange symbols on the floor beneath his corpse
Investigators said the wood was scorched when he died
When he died
They found so many scorpions inside his lungs
When he died
The statues of his missing children cried
What was later found to be his blood
When he died (on a dark and stormy night)
They telephoned his wife (who reacted with delight)
But gradually her voice began to fade to nothing
And the laughing record played, the laughing record played
When he died
They found a message etched into his spine
That said when he died
An endless age of untold nightmares would be nigh
And the blood would make the seas run red
When he died (on a dark and stormy night)
A nearby shed caught fire (it simply caught alight)
And when they cleared the charred wood from the ground
Inside they found a painting of a clown (a creepy painting of a clown)
He'd painted it when he was just a child
But scrawled upon the back was exactly when he died
When he died
When he died
When he died
When he died

SWEET BOD:

Your body is so sweet now, baby
I'm saying trick or treat now
You know I've got to have you, yeah
You sexy sweet cadaver
All wrapped up like a mummy (ooh-ooh)
I'll cover you in honey
And wait a hundred years or so (oh-whoa, oh, oh)
You know, you know it isn't sexual (it isn't sexual)
Strictly confectional (strictly confectional)
Strictly medicinal (strictly medicinal)
If a little nontraditional
I'm digging up your coffin
And pouring out the contents
Your sexy sweet solution
Is prime for distribution
Sweet bod
Your body's starting rumors
Of Mason jars of sweetness
Whose satisfied consumers
Have often claimed to witness
Some sexy shrinking tumors, oh
A sweet return to fitness
They're just a hundred bucks or so (oh-whoa, oh, oh)
You know, you know it isn't sexual (it isn't sexual)
Strictly professional (strictly professional)
Entrepreneurial (entrepreneurial)
Oh, and what a sweet memorial
I'm digging up your coffin
And pouring out the contents
Good God, I'm glad to see you
Won't you be my panacea?
Sweet bod
Sweet bod
Oh, sweet bod
Sweet bod
Sweet bod

What in the name of God can I be?

ANCIENT ALEINS:

My mind's this cave
So dark, no moon, no stars
No sound
Just hearts and walls of art
Strange things happen
For no reason
That's all I know
My mind's this cave

SOFT FUZZY MAN:

Cold and windy
Dark and stormy
Let me float your way
Please don't ignore me
What you girls really need's a soft, fuzzy man
(An ambient man)
A trick of the light to love you tonight
You don't understand, there's nothing quite like a soft, fuzzy man
Can't you see me?
Why can't you see me?
I'm all around, all cold and dreamy
What you girls really need's a soft, fuzzy man
(A wisp of smoke man)
To waft over you and cloud up your view
So show me your hands and wave them right through a soft, fuzzy man
Although I have no arms to hold you in a human passion burns within me
I need to feel like I exist
So please baby, please baby, step into the mist
Don't be nervous
No, don't be nervous
I'm not like other guys who have a surface
What you girls really need's a soft, fuzzy man
(An atmospheric man)
A shimmering puff of indistinct love
What's better than the vague embrace of a soft, fuzzy man?
Who seeps through your thoughts
Who makes you see spots
Who blows through the air
Who plays with your hair
I know it sounds crazy, but once you go hazy, you'll understand
I'm your soft, fuzzy man

SPIRAL OF ANTS:

Over and over
The pheromones, the overwhelming harmony
Consuming the colony
The Circle rules your life
Chop, chop! Don't want to be late
Lift up and carry your weight
You've got no choice but to dance in a spiral of ants
True bugs might laugh in your face
Don't fret, you're leading the race
Don't let the bastards step on your hands in a spiral of ants

You've got to keep it flowing
You are one ant

Creating its own gravity

And the bugs who laughed got blown away
As we proclaimed:
The Circle rules your life

AMNESIA WAS HER NAME:

Amnesia was her name, she had beautiful eyes
And every word she said, it was a little surprise
Can't remember when I realized I was in love, la-la-love
Can't remember who it was I was thinking of
Oh my god... oh my god
The doctor said that I had tomato loss, all right
Dr. Amnesia was her name, she had beautiful eyes
We had spaghetti with long term memory sauce, all right
And every word she said, it was a little surprise
Can't remember how she smiled when she said my name...
What's my name?
Can't remember cause my heart jumped and hit my brain
I guess she didn't know how treat me right
Because I can't recall where I slept that night
I can't recall that special way
She told me, each and every day, her name
I can't recall the fact that I always said I loved her back
The same way, every time the same
The doctor said that I had beautiful eyes, all right
Amnesia was her name, she had memory loss... no wait
And every word I said, it was a little surprising, all right
And every word she said didn't make it across
Can't remember when we walked past the O.R. sign, surgery
Can't remember passing out with her hand in mine, my-my-mind
I remember waking up with my mind repaired, a-okay
I remember when I realized she wasn't there

MARKETLAND:

Market Town
What a doozy walking 'round
With all these putrid people everywhere
"You've gotta buy this!"
Screams a whiskey stinking vermin vendor
Holding up a rotten pear
But I hold on to my dollar
Looking all around me
In this place, I hide my face
But dirty people hound me
Market Street
I could use a bite to eat
But I don't want to buy a whole raw fish, no
No, not a blanket!
Yes, it's lovely but I'm hungry
And that's really not my favorite dish
So I hold on to my moolah
My mazuma, money
There's no trash that's worth my cash
It all just smells too funny
In Marketland
You can buy what's in demand
15 years ago, wow
In Marketland
All the world is in your hand
I'd go wash it off now
Market Lane
Either I'm going insane
Or there's an urchin hawking book reports
Oh, that's a new one
Some old guy with just one eye's
Selling his obviously soiled shorts
But I hold on to my dollar
Looking all around me
In this place, I hide my face
But dirty people hound me
Market Hell
There's no food too old to sell
There is no merchandise too urine-stained
"You've gotta buy this!"
Scream the whiskey stinking vermin vendors
Well, at least I'm entertained
Still I hold on to my moolah
My mazuma, money
There's no trash that's worth my cash
It all just smells too funny
In Marketland
You can buy what's in demand
Fifteen years ago, wow
In Marketland
All the world is in your hand
I'd go wash it off now

THE ONLY HOUSE THAT'S NOT ON FIRE (YET):

I feel knotted up today
But in a most exquisite way
Like neckties or like macramé
Bowlines and zeppelin bends
If you were a theremin
I wouldn't know where to begin
My hands would stay here on my chin
With a hum that never ends
This suit doesn't fit me
I made it myself, counterfeitly
With buttons of blue
Killing me with déjà vu
It's a gift for you
When I escape at last
When enough time has passed
But something keeps me as a pet
The only house that's not on fire yet
I made it when I was an architect
This is just the side effect
I feel strangely regular
But honestly, I prefer it to
The usual bizarre
Damn that oxymoron
If you were a piece of dust
I'd shine a light through the busted window
And I'd learn to trust
In the updraft that you're on
Click, click, auto-focus
The film's in the can like hocus-pocus
A picture of you
Killing me with déjà vu
Don't know what I'll do when I escape at last
When the end of time has passed
But something keeps me as a pet
The only house that's not on fire yet
I made it when I was an architect
This is just the side effect
The punch line is there is no punch line
The punch line is there is no punch line
The punch line is there is no punch line
The punch line is that there is no punch line
The punch line is there is no punch line
The punch line is that there is no punch line
The punch line is there is no punch line
The punch line is there is no punch line
Oh! I just thought of how to change all the hate
Into love with the old switcheroo
Dancing in my déjà vu
You'll be dancing, too
When I escape at last
When the future is the past
But something keeps me as a pet
The only house that's not on fire yet
The only house that's not on fire yet
The only house that's not on fire yet
The only house that's not on fire... (yet!)

THE AFTERNOON:

See the footprints in the cave?
I would follow them if I were brave
To find out why there's no second set of
Footprints in the cave
In the attic of this house
On the wall behind a propped up couch
Is a door that somehow leads into
The basement of this house
Oh, the less you hold out
More and more will fold out
Live for the afternoon
But oh, the more you grow up
Less and less will show up
Guess it's gotta blow up soon!
If you take another look
In the workings of your pop up book
There's a secret message left there for you
Take another look
If you choose a place to dig
And you make a hole that's deep and big enough
You will find exactly what you need
A place to dig
Yeah
Okay now
Okay, what?
Okay yeah
Oh oh oh oh, the less you hold out
More and more will fold out
Live for the afternoon
But oh, the more you grow up
Less and less will show up
Guess it's gotta blow up soon
Ooh, the less you hold out
More and more will fold out
Live for the afternoon
But oh, the more you grow up
Less and less will show up
Guess it's gotta blow up soon

BILL WATTERSON:

Where'd you go when you were done?
I'd like to know what you've become
Your biggest fan, awake at dawn
I cry, I stand on your front lawn
It's plain to see you're scared of me
But that's not how it's supposed to be
When you're the reason I'm in town
And every piece of mind you put down
Don't you know I think that you're the cat's meow?
Where's the tiger now? Where's the tiger now?
Bill Watterson, can't you hear me? (Bill Watterson, can't you hear me?)
Bill Watterson, please don't fear me (Bill Watterson, please don't fear me)
Don't treat me like I have rabies
I only wanna have your babies
Tracing lines with fingertips
I saw the signs within these strips
And through the fog, between the frames
Of dialogue, I saw my name
And now I know where I must go
To show you that I love you so
So I brought books for you to sign
And I brought shears to cut your phone line
Don't you know I think that you're the cat's meow?
Where's the tiger now? Where's the tiger now?
Bill Watterson, can't you hear me? (Bill Watterson, can't you hear me?)
Bill Watterson, please don't fear me (Bill Watterson, please don't fear me)
Don't stare at me from your window
I know you wanna let me in
Though, oh, you want me to show
How much I believe and prove how far I'll go to meet you
Through thunderstorms and snow
Well, I would do anything
And, oh, I happen to know
The reason you're hiding from publicity
It's not out of eccentricity
But rather for privacy when you meet me
And when we meet, I'll be complete
I'll shake your hand and kiss your feet
Confess my love and buy you flowers
And eat your heart and absorb your powers
Don't you know I think that you're the cat's meow?
Oh-oh-oh
Where's the tiger now? Where's the tiger now?
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Bill Watterson, can't you hear me? (Bill Watterson, can't you hear me?)
Bill Watterson, please don't fear me (Bill Watterson, please don't fear me)
Don't run from me like I'm Jason
I only wanna try your face on

SUNDIAL:

Don't mind me, I've just got some problems to work out
I'm only passing through or maybe just right out
Somehow something set my sundial backwards tilted and upside-down
Now the shadow hand is pointing time right out of town
I cease to see you when I start to shut my eyes
And I forget that I had said my last goodbyes
Quickly I reopen them and bid you all "Cheerio, my friend"
This goes on for hours and it never seems to end
I don't remember what it is that I just said to you
I've got Anubis on my back and something in my shoe
Don't walk backwards, don't be jealous
You're so bloody overzealous
I think I think I am unsure of what to say
Live long and prosper while the winter melts away
Sticks and stones and traffic cones may keep me safe while they break my bones
Needles live in haystacks like a swarm of tiny drones
Can't keep my extra senses charged for very long
Can't bear to tell you that you're wrong, so very wrong
Can't believe this brief reprieve is stretching outward and up my sleeve
Simply begs the question, how could I be so naïve?
I don't remember what it is that I just said to you
I've got Anubis on my back and something in my shoe
Don't walk backwards, don't be jealous
You're so bloody overzealous
Don't walk forwards, don't be silly, you're the heel they call Achilles's
Don't enjoy this private screening, this one doesn't have a meaning

SKY IS NOT BLUE:

I made you these construction paper dolls
Connected by the hands with tiny little faces
And now I'll hang them on the walls
So you can see the people filling up the spaces
I think I am the only one
To ever realize that I am
The only one to realize what's true
When all the world is stuck in a jam
The sky is not blue
I made you this defective little song
Connected by the chords, connected and melodic
And if you think I sing it wrong
Or if you think it sounds a little too robotic
Just let me know, I'll understand
And maybe when I play it next week
I'll think of you and make it pristine
As long as you repeat after me
The grass is not green
I might have stated what I thought before
I might have kept it in, my memory is failing
I might have stumbled through the door
You might have stared and asked what I had been inhaling
I might have blinked, I might have sighed
I might have been a has-might-have-been
But if you really heard what I said
You'd understand the mindset I'm in
Where roses aren't red
I'm setting up my tiny little town
A Lego set in which I'm planning to retire
It's really time I settled down
But not before I set everything on fire
Put on my boots, and stamp it out
The little yellow people don't care
They never did, and they never do
And yet they seem to speak with their stare
They tell me things I can't deny
They tell me I'm a sap, I'm a square
They tell me things I already knew
The greatest of the secrets they share
The sky is not blue

GEEKS IN LOVE:

Nobody's cool as we, nor quite as esoterically far out.
We're so far out it's creepy.
I don't think they'll ever get the groovy standards that we set for love,
but they're not smart like we be.
They have no roses.
Subconsciously they envy us a lot.
They look down their noses and see a couple of dorks with more love than they have got.
When they see us holding hands, they wish that they were geeks in love.
And when they hear our favorite bands, they wish that they were geeks in love.
We rattle off our in-jokes while they wish that they were geeks in love.
And while we make each other smile, they wish that they were geeks in...
La la la,
la la la,
la-lubbidy-da-diddy-love.
La la la,
la la la,
ka-boominy-wall-nutty-love.
La la la,
la la la,
ga-shibbidy-waffles-and-love.
La la la,
la la la la love.
As far as I can tell, while other lovers go through hell,
we'll know we're too cool for damnation.
We may not be cutting edge, but we won't take the mainstream pledge,
for we don't need your admiration.
They may not show it.
It doesn't fit their made-up little roles.
They don't even know it, but jealousy abounds within their souls.
When they see us on the street, they wish that they were geeks in love.
And when they hear us trick or treat, they wish that they were geeks in love.
As we lock arms and skip away, they wish that they were geeks in love.
And you can almost hear them say they wish that they were geeks in...
La la la,
la la la,
la-lubbidy-do-diddy-love.
La la la,
la la la,
fa-doobidy-ding-dong-love.
La la la,
la la la,
za-muppety-puppety-love.
La la la,

La la la,

La la la,

PUMPKIN PIE:

There lived a merchant in the days of old
Who is remembered for the things he sold
No silly trinkets, silver, bronze, or gold
So I'm told, so I'm told
He made a most delicious pumpkin pie
Which he presented to the passersby
Before the sunset he'd be all but dry
Folks would buy the whole supply
He lived alone (he lived alone)
And every night he sat upon a throne of pumpkin pie
I do not know his name (he'd never say his name)
He never wanted all the fame that came with pumpkin pie
Before you knew it he was in full swing
His pumpkin pies became the next big thing
Soon he was called upon to feed the king
And they'd sing, feed the king
The pie of pumpkin filled the king with glee
He offered a castle for the recipe, but
The merchant wouldn't even give it up for three
No not he, no not he
He lived alone (he lived alone)
And every night he sat upon a throne of pumpkin pie
I do not know his name (he'd never say his name)
He never wanted all the fame that came with pumpkin pie
The king was angry and he came unwound
He called his men and soon the merchant found
Himself in a torture chamber underground
Tied and bound, he sighed and frowned
And so they tortured him for night and day
They made him scream so much his hair turned gray, but
As for the recipe, he would not say
They could not flay his pride away
He lived alone (he lived alone)
And every night he sat upon a throne of pumpkin pie
I do not know his name (he'd never say his name)
He never wanted all the pain that came with pumpkin pie

STUCK:

I'm just walking along
Stuck in a song, whistling thusly
Stereotypical life
Kids and a wife, three of them, plus me
Neil's inspiration is thin, thin as a pin
There isn't much to me
So I'm just walking along
Stuck in a song, happily gloomy
Break it off, break it off, take me out
Don't let the melody fake me out
Break it off, break it off, take me out
Don't let the melody fake me out
I don't even have a name
This brings me shame, I'm so diminished
I know all songs have an end
I could pretend this one is finished
I guess both ways I am screwed
Maybe if you'd do me a favour
If this track's on a CD, skip it for me
You'd be my saviour
Break it off, break it off, take me out
Don't let the melody fake me out
Oh, break it off, break it off, take me out
Don't let the melody fake me out
Break it off, break it off, take me out
Don't let the melody fake me out
(Don't)
Break it off, break it off, take me out
Don't let the melody fake me out
Oh, no
Oh, no
Oh, no
Oh, no
Oh, no

NEW WAY OUT:

One, two, a-one, two, three, four.
Burger King fries on a dashboard underneath the burning hot sun.
Burger King fries on a dashboard underneath the burning hot sun.
Serpentine alarm clock, ringing up a horrid little
kamikaze ding dinga-ding ding ding.
Serpentine alarm clock, ringing up a horrid little
kamikaze ding dinga-ding ding ding.
Jimi Hendrix Jr. with rock 'n' roll soccer mom.
Putting Michael Jackson on a rocket ship to Vietnam.
Burger King fries on a dashboard underneath the burning hot sun.
Burger King fries on a dashboard underneath the burning hot sun.
Nana korobi ya oki.
Ro-ma wa ichinichi ni shite narazu, baby.
I don't know my way around,
but if I follow every sound,
a new way out is soon surrounding me.
"And lo and behold, the very next morning,
they climbed out of bed and gazed out upon the morning world,
and to their complete and utter amazement,
it had not snowed at all.
The End.
Don't mean to bug, but I thought I'd tell you that your shoes are untied.
Don't mean to bug, but I thought I'd tell you that your shoes are untied.
In livin' in an illin' villakin I kinda caterwauled,
"Olly olly oxen free!"
In livin' in an illin' villakin I kinda caterwauled,
"Marco! Polo! Viva sanity!"
Oh, running 'round in circles like a Chupacabra Capybara.
Jamming on the harpsichord to Chris-a-tina Aguilera.
Don't mean to bug, but I thought I'd tell you that your shoes are untied.
Don't mean to bug, but I thought I'd tell you that your shoes are untied.
Nana korobi ya oki.
Ro-ma wa ichinichi ni shite narazu, baby.
I don't know my way around,
but if I follow every sound,
a new way out is soon surrounding me.

WHAT WILL HAPPEN WILL HAPPEN:

So what if I'm down? Stuck in reverse.
I look around... It could be worse.
What can I do?
Honestly, I've got nothing to offer at all.
Why should I grieve?
Why should I fall?
I'd rather breath, cover my ears, open my eyes and see what appears.
What will happen will happen whether I'm happy or sad.
What will happen will happen whether I'm happy or sad.
There are days to wake up for. There are dreams to be had.
What will happen will happen whether I'm happy or sad.
There's a reason I'm freezing at eighty degrees in a summery season:
I'm totally mad.
So, I'll let it go.
No need to sink now that I know that I can think,
therefore I am able to choose when I give a damn.
I refuse to be dumb.
This is my niche.
I won't become misery's bitch if I can hold apathy under total control.
What will happen will happen whether I'm happy or sad.
What will happen will happen whether I'm happy or sad.
There are days to wake up for. There are dreams to be had.
What will happen will happen whether I'm happy or sad,
and there's a reason I'm freezing at eighty degrees in a summery season:
I'm totally mad.
Not a hip hopped, not a heart stopped.
Everybody's gone stone cold crazy, like a cherry tree chopped.
Maybe Martin Scorsese's new movie just flopped, or
maybe some baby in a groovy helicopter.
We do, we do nothing but hold the window shut to keep the worry out.
We never wanna see the daylight fade.
We gotta masquerade to keep the worry out.
...But they have ways of making me think.
I can't blink, can't drink,
Can't put up a stink about the rattling battling and the countdown paddling
the motherland straddling the weaky freak link.
We do, we do nothing but hold the window shut to keep the worry out.
We never wanna see the daylight fade.
We gotta masquerade to keep the worry out.
Imagine a world without the Unabombers, and the Jeffrey Dahmers.
Wouldn't we be calmer?
Now, of course by "we" I'm only speaking for me,
but it's easy to assume that other people agree, you see.
We do, we do nothing but hold the window shut to keep the worry out.
We never wanna see the daylight fade.
We gotta masquerade to keep the worry out.
If I, at my own convenience, forget what they say,
I find it easy to focus on living each day.
If I could change it I would, to do what someone else should...
but I believe that the problem is misunderstood.
What will happen will happen whether I'm happy or sad.
What will happen will happen whether I'm happy or sad.
There are days to wake up for. There are dreams to be had.
What will happen will happen whether I'm happy or sad...

DEAD SEA MONKEYS:

I love my brine shrimp pals.
They are my friends.
I watch them float around inside their tank.
But when I came back home from school today my little
friends were dead and I was sad.
The other day they were alive, and now they're floating at the top.
I knew they wouldn't last forever,
and now they're just a bunch of dead sea monkeys.
Will my sea monkeys go to heaven?
Will my sea monkeys go to hell?
Will my sea monkeys go to heaven?
Will my sea monkeys go to hell?
The other day they were alive, and now they're floating at the top
I knew they wouldn't live forever,
and now they're just a bunch of dead sea monkeys.
Dead sea monkeys, dead sea monkeys, dead sea monkeys.
My brine shrimp pals have died a grisly death.
Why must the things I love just disappear?
Is it my fault?
Did I forget their food?
I hope they're in a better place right now.
Will my sea monkeys go to heaven? Yes!
Will my sea monkeys go to hell? No!
Will my sea monkeys go to heaven? Yes!
Will my sea monkeys go to hell? No!
I miss 'em, I miss 'em, me oh my!
I miss 'em, I miss 'em, me oh my!
I miss 'em, I miss 'em, me oh my!
I miss 'em, I miss 'em, me oh my!
The other day they were alive, and now they're floating at the top
I knew they wouldn't live forever,
and now they're just a bunch of dead sea monkeys.
Dead sea monkeys, dead sea monkeys, dead sea monkeys.
I want my monkeys back.
Give my monkeys back!
I want my monkeys back,
Jesus Christ!
I want my monkeys back.
Give my monkeys back!
I want my monkeys back,
Jesus Christ!
I want my monkeys back.
Give my monkeys back!
I want my monkeys back,
Jesus Christ!
I want my monkeys back.
Gimme my monkeys back!
I want my monkeys back,
Jesus flippin' Christ!
Dead sea monkeys, dead sea monkeys, dead sea monkeys...

FLAMINGO LEGS:

I love when opportunity knocks
It rocks the stripes right outta my socks
I love the world and everything else
The trampolines and jingling bells
I'd love to say there's not a thing I detest
I'd love to tie a piece of string to the best
Of what I know and keep it near, but I won't
I'd love to feel devoid of fear, but I don't
And I prefer it that way, I prefer it that way now
Living, living underneath a rock
Injuriously curious, the outline drawn in chalk
I know the words but don't understand
The karaoke effigy man
Flamingo legs of yellow and green
Attached to grandma's sewing machine
I'd love to say it's only fair, but it's not
I'd love to form a perfect square
I forgot my love of rolling down the hill on the lawn
I never noticed it until it was gone
And I prefer it that way, I prefer it that way now
Living, living underneath a rock
Living (under the catacomb)
In this (pile of styrofoam)
Outline drawn in chalk

KITTEN IS ANGRY:

My kitten, my kitty cat.
When she's content she purrs.
She thinks the house is hers.
But you won't like her when she's angry.
No, you won't like her when she's angry.
Angry, angry.
She's cuddly.
She's lovely when she's in a happy mood.
She loves her kitten food.
But she's got such an attitude...
Completely rotten attitude.
Rotten attitude.
Kitten is angry, kitten is offended.
Fur standing out and little claws extended.
Darting around and meowing quite a bit,
and throwing such a hissy fit.
I don't know what to make of it.
Don't touch her.
Don't look at her.
My kitten knows TAE KWON DO.
She can take you out, I know.
I've seen it before and it's not pretty.
She's really one ferocious kitty cat now.
(Oh no.)
She's deadly.
She'll hurt you.
She'll show you endless pain.
Her little whiskers are stained with the blood of those that she has slain.
Believe me, she will go insane.
She will go insane.
Kitten is angry, kitten is offended.
Fur standing out and little claws extended.
Darting around and meowing quite a bit,
and throwing such a hissy fit.
I don't know what to make of it.
Kitten is angry, full of discontentment.
Wildly attacking random pieces of lint.
Darting around in a psychotic blitz,
and throwing all these hissy fits,
but I still love my kitty cat to bits!

FINE:

Today has a way of scarring your eyes
With negative light, but it's a disguise
I put on my shades and see through the lies
The convenient truth is
Light is on the way, we'll be having a fun time
It's such a lovely day, we should pocket the sunshine
And never give it back, even if there's a heat wave
Or terrorist attack, it will just be a close shave
I know (I know)
That every bomb has a silver lining
I know (I know)
It won't be long until
Everything works out nice in the end
The sun will marry the moon
It'll be fine
Why don't we sit back, mellow again
And have a nice afternoon?
It'll be fine
I go for a walk, the sidewalk is cracked
I'm not superstitious, but I made a pact
With old Mother Earth, she'd get off my back
If I get off hers
Light is on the way, we'll be having a fun time
It's such a lovely day, we should pocket the sunshine
And never give it back, even if there's a heat wave
We're stalling on the track, it will just be a close shave
I know (I know)
That in a snap, all the birds will sing
I know (I know)
I'm full of crap, but still
Everything works out nice in the end
The sun will marry the moon
It'll be fine
Why don't we sit back, mellow again
And have a nice afternoon?
It'll be fine
Fine, fine, fine
Everything is gonna be
Fine, fine, fine
Everything is gonna be
Fine, fine, fine
Everything is gonna be
Fine, fine, fine
Everything is gonna be
Everything works out nice in the end
The sun will marry the moon
It'll be fine
Why don't we sit back, mellow again
And have a nice afternoon?
It'll be fine
Everything works out nice in the end (I know)
The sun will marry the moon (that every bomb)
Works out nice in the end (has a silver lining, I know)
Why don't we sit back mellow again (I know)
And have a nice afternoon? (It won't be long until)
Sit back mellow again
Everything works out nice in the end
The sun will marry the moon
It'll be fine
Why don't we sit back mellow again
And have a nice afternoon?
It'll be fine, fine, fine, fine

THE ULTIMATE SHOWDOWN OF ULTIMATE DESTINY:

Old Godzilla was hopping around
Tokyo City like a big playground
When suddenly Batman burst from the shade
And hit Godzilla with a Batgrenade
Godzilla got pissed and began to attack
But didn't expect to be blocked by Shaq
Who proceeded to open up a can of Shaq-Fu
When Aaron Carter came out of the blue
And he started beating up Shaquille O'Neal
Then they both got flattened by the Batmobile
But before it could make it back to the Batcave
Abraham Lincoln popped out of his grave
And took an AK-47 out from under his hat
And blew Batman away with a rat-a-tat-tat
But he ran out of bullets and he ran away
Because Optimus Prime came to save the day
This is the ultimate showdown of ultimate destiny
Good guys, bad guys, and explosions as far as the eye can see
And only one will survive, I wonder who it will be
This is the ultimate showdown of ultimate destiny
Godzilla took a bite out of Optimus Prime
Like Scruff McGruff took a bite out of crime
And then Shaq came back covered in a tire track
But Jackie Chan jumped out and landed on his back
And Batman was injured, and trying to get steady
When Abraham Lincoln came back with a machete
But suddenly something caught his leg and he tripped
Indiana Jones took him out with his whip
Then he saw Godzilla sneaking up from behind
And he reached for his gun which he just couldn't find
'Cause Batman stole it and he shot and he missed
And Jackie Chan deflected it with his fist
Then he jumped in the air and did a somersault
While Abraham Lincoln tried to pole vault
Onto Optimus Prime, but they collided in the air
Then they both got hit by a Care Bear stare
This is the ultimate showdown of ultimate destiny
Good guys, bad guys, and explosions as far as the eye can see
And only one will survive, I wonder who it will be
This is the ultimate showdown
Angels sang out an immaculate chorus
Down from the heavens descended Chuck Norris
Who delivered a kick which could shatter bones
Into the crotch of Indiana Jones
Who fell over on the ground, writhing in pain
As Batman changed back into Bruce Wayne
But Chuck saw through his clever disguise
And he crushed Batman's head in between his thighs
Then Gandalf the Grey and Gandalf the White
And Monty Python and the Holy Grail's black knight
And Benito Mussolini and the Blue Meanie
And Cowboy Curtis and Jambi the Genie
Robocop, The Terminator, Captain Kirk, and Darth Vader
Lo-pan, Superman, every single Power Ranger
Bill S. Preston and Theodore Logan
Spock, The Rock, Doc Ock, and Hulk Hogan
All came out of nowhere lightning fast
And they kicked Chuck Norris in his cowboy ass
It was the bloodiest battle that the world ever saw
With civilians looking on in total awe
The fight raged on for a century
Many lives were claimed, but eventually
The champion stood, the rest saw their better
Mr. Rogers in a bloodstained sweater
This is the ultimate showdown of ultimate destiny
Good guys, bad guys, and explosions as far as the eye can see
And only one will survive, I wonder who it will be
This is the ultimate showdown
(The ultimate showdown)
This is the ultimate showdown
(The ultimate showdown)
This is the ultimate showdown
Of ultimate destiny

DINOSAURCHESTRA PART ONE:

Travel back in time with me
Two hundred million B.C.
What's your name and what do you play?

This may be less than pleasant
(Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh)
What's that rock way up in the sky?
That's our friend, Super Duper Meteor!
Does this mean we're all gonna die?
Shook my Magic 8-Ball, and it said
"As a powerful and complex computer of near omniscience
I can report with total confidence
After a careful .3 seconds calculating a whole world of probability and statistics
That yes, we are all gonna die"
Dinosaurchestra, Dinosaurchestra, Dinosaurchestra

We'll all be blown up real soon
(Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh)
But not before we're in tune

VOW OF SILENCE:

I'll never have a chance to say
Everything I want to say
But that's okay
I don't need to say a thing anyway
Just want to take it in
See the world, watch it spin
Learn to play the violin
I'll even try to shed
Any words from my head
Think in Mentalese instead
Don't call me on a telephone
I don't wanna be alone
But I have grown out of it
So, leave a message at the tone
Just want to take it in
See the world, watch it spin
And learn to play the violin
I'll even try to shed
Any words from my head
Think in Mentalese instead
And I'll take a vow of silence
Shut up, shut up, shut up
I'll take a vow of silence
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Shut up, shut up, shut up
I'll take a vow of
Silence means that you can't speak
You can't let things out, they stay inside
You just sit and nod like a quiet freak
And you hold your tongue and you swallow your pride
And if you're travelling down the street and suddenly witness a crime
You gotta keep it to yourself, you gotta keep it inside your quiet little mind
Until the end of time
And you've got to shut up, shut up, shut up (seen and not heard)
Shut up, shut up, shut up (not a single word)
Shut up, shut up, shut up (for the rest of your life)
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Now, I'm no silent snob
But Teller and Silent Bob
Tend to do an awful job
But let me tell you, son
Harpo Marx is the one
I wouldn't be surprised if he didn't have a tongue
Woah, I'll take a vow of silence
Shut up, shut up, shut up
I'll take a vow of silence
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Shut up, shut up, shut up
I'll take a vow of
I'll take a vow of
I'll take a vow of
Silence, silence, silence

ACTION MOVIE HERO BOY:

I gotta figure out where Mommy keeps the dynamite
I'll get some measuring tape, so I can time it right
I know it's dangerous, I know you're thinking I am a fool
But it's the only chance I'll ever get to look so cool
(Look so cool)
Hey, look at me
Casually walking away
Like action movie hero boy!
In slo-mo
Everything glowing and blowing to bits right behind me!
You see it all the time in theaters on the silver screen
Like when the good guy blows the bad guy's house to smithereens
I got a movie making camera and a dozen grenades
I'm looking tough, I got the stuff, I got the spiffy shades!
(Spiffy shades)
Hey, look at me
Casually walking away
Like action movie hero boy!
In slo-mo
Everything glowing and blowing to bits right behind me!
I am aware it's just a movie
I'm aware it's a cliche
I am aware I'm being stupid
I'm aware of that, but hey
This is just something I gotta do, yeah!
Hey, look at me
Casually stumbling down
Like action movie blooper reel!
In slo-mo
Everything glowing and blowing to bits, including me!

THE MAN IN STRIPES AND GLASSES:

The man in stripes and glasses!
The man in stripes and glasses!
The man in stripes and glasses shouted
"Where am I?"
Before a giant cartoon magnifying glass invaded from the sky
And made a red and white bespectacled skeleton out of the poor guy
Well, we never got his name
Or a very good look
We collected his remains in a box of books
Well, we took the books out first
Arranged them best to worst
Just as a waste of time
And then we put the bones in alphabetically
Sealed it up hermetically
And never ever spoke of it again
But every single night
We see a red and white bespectacled skeleton
In the corner of our eye
The man in stripes and glasses was dead!
Dead
Dead!
(Dead, dead, dead, dead, dead
Dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead!)
Forever
(Muahahaha!)
Laugh
(Ahh!)
Scream
(Whooo)
Wind
(Oooh!)
Ghosts
(Err... pwoof!)
Creaky door
(Ahh! Ahh!)
Amputation
(Awoo!)
Wolf
(Nyahahaha!)

NEVERENDUNG HUM:

Inside of everybody's head
Inside of everybody's head
There is a hum
There's a hum
There's a never-ending hum
And no one ever seems to notice it
No one seems to notice it
You have never noticed it
Never ever, never ever
Until now!
Deep in the dankest corners of the human mind
Of any given person that you happen to see
There rests a creature
Or more specifically
A creature, hiding and sitting
In the churning, boiling, philosophical pot
Of self-aware chowder that we call thought
This creature has a name
But it's different for each person
Mine is named Corey
And it looks like an armadillo
In kiss make-up!
Jabbidy jabbidy jabbidy jabbajibba jabba
Jabbidy jabbidy jabbidy jabbajibba jabba
Jabbidy jabbidy jabbidy jabbajibba jabba
Jabbidy jabbidy jabbidy jabbajibba jabba
Picture your spirit in a delicatessen
In the slums of the universe
"Open" sign dangling, daring all parasites
Giving you mosquito bites
Sucking the life out of all of your customers
But fear not, it's your critter to the rescue
Hum emanating from its lips
And fear disappears
As the parasite trips
And lands in a puddle
And that's your rebuttal
To the argument that you
Weren't even listening to
Because of the never-ending hum
(Mmmm)
Jabbidy jabbidy jabbidy jabbajibba jabba
Jabbidy jabbidy jabbidy jabbajibba jabba
Jabbidy jabbidy jabbidy jabbajibba jabba
Jabbidy jabbidy jabbidy jabbajibba

YOU'RE THE PARTY:

Hour hand's gone from two to three, now four
You've barely slept all night
All the noise and lights and party songs next door
Are too much
They make you sweat
Half awake, soaking wet
Fever dream
People screaming bloody murder
Paint chips flaking off the neighboring wall
And as the night goes on and threatens dawn
The music fills the hall
They're in your house
You lock the door
You shut you eyes tight as your window breaks
Someone, something takes your hand
You don't understand
You can't understand it
Eyes shut tight, never open up
(Too late)
You've been invited
(Too late)
You're at the party
(Wake up, wake up)
And it's a place you've seen before
You're seen before
A place you've seen before you were born
Now you are dancing
You're with your people
You're not alone
Now you are drinking
Having a party
You're not alone
(Too late)
You are the party
(Wake up)
You are the nuisance
(Too late)
You're not alone
(Wake up)
It's not a nightmare
(Too late)
You are delightful
(Wake up)
You're not alone
(Too late)
You've been invited
(Wake up)
You're at the party
(Too late)
You're not alone
(Wake up)
You've been invited
(Too late)
You're at the party and you notice that the
Sun's not rising and the birds are dead
There's only dust on the floor where people were before
And the dream won't leave your head
It won't leave
You need a drink
Half-empty bottles in the sink
Down the drain
Sudden rain outside alarms you
Hour hand's gone and now you're feeling strange
Now your hands grow strong
Your fingers long
And your face...
Your face begins to change
You're mesmerized
You want to cover up your eyes
But they're already shut so tight
Whisper in your ear
Only you can hear
Only you can hear it
Eyes shut tight, never open up
Too late
Too late
You've been invited
You're at the party
It's a place you've seen before
(Too late)
You've been invited
(Too late)
You're at the party
(Wake up, wake up)
And it's a place you've seen before
You've seen before
A place you've seen before you were born
Before you were born
Before you were born
Before you were born
(Too late)
You've been invited
(Wake up)
You're at the party
(Too late)
You're not alone
(Wake up)
You've been invited
(Too late)
You're at the party
(Wake up)
You're not alone
(Too late)
You are the uproar
(Wake up)
You are the party
(Too late)
You're not alone
(Wake up)
It's not a nightmare
(Too late)
You're at the party and you're not alone

LOVE, ME NORMALLY:

In lipstick on the mirror
Are the lyrics to my obituary
In iambic pentameter, followed parameter
Crossing my eyes, dot my T's
I was delivered holding scissors
I live deliberately, I'm a quitter
And a winner anyway
Cause I never agreed to participate in this game
Won't follow my dreams
No, they've all got me waking up screaming
I can let them go from me
After all there is no "I" in team
And I'd rather be normal. Yes, so normal
I suggest that we keep this informal
Cause a normal human being wouldn't need
To pretend to be normal to be normal
Well I guess that's the least that I owe ya
To be normal in a way I couldn't be
C'mon, c'mon, and love me normally
If I could live in third person
Well I don't think life would be much worse than it is
In the current tense, presently
This sentence ending with question marks or dot dot dot
Is it courageous or escapist
To leave the quarantine when you're contagious
It may just be a cold
And besides I don't wanna get old
I drank myself to death to be the afterlife of the party
When the afterparty came, I was rolling in my grave
And I'd rather be normal. Yes, so normal
I suggest that we keep this informal
Cause a normal human being wouldn't need
To pretend to be normal to be normal
Well I guess that's the least that I owe ya
To be normal in a way I couldn't be
C'mon, c'mon, and love me normally
Now this is the part of the song where I like to talk to my audience
I like to tell 'em there's something I want from you hep cats tonight
I want you to look to your left, look to your right
Your 12 o'clock, three o'clock, six o'clock, nine o'clock, rock around the clock tonight
And I want you to find those points of no return, those singularities
Those burning rings of fire in the beautiful pupils of the beautiful eyes of the beautiful
Boy, girl, neither, both, or in-between that you brought with you tonight
And I want you to tell 'em how you really feel
I want you to tell 'em that you love the way they so seamlessly, like a dreamfully
So beautifully, oh so dutifully
Jam that square peg in the round hole in their heart
I want you to tell 'em that you love the way
That they don't stick out like sore middle fingers
That they crawl their way up the side of the bell curve
Stick their flag in the peak, and slide their way back down
I want you to tell them that you love the way that they're not maladaptive
Not malcontent, not malignant or maleficent, but rather that you love them
Exactly the way that everybody else is
I was nothing before so I couldn't have asked to be born
I'll be nothing again, so what am I between now and then
Is there nothing to fear? Cause shit's getting weird
So to God who made this man, you better have one hell of a plan
I'd rather be normal. Yes, so normal
I suggest that we keep this informal
Cause a normal human being wouldn't need. No
To pretend to be normal to be normal
Well I guess that's the least that I owe ya
To be normal in a way I could never be
C'mon, c'mon, yeah, I said c'mon, yeah
C'mon, c'mon, yeah, I said c'mon, yeah
C'mon, c'mon, and love me normally

I / ME/ MYSELF:

I've been feeling lightheaded
Since I lost enough weight to fit back in my skin
Flower petals and feathers tether me to the ground
Pound for pound
Take my tea with formaldehyde for my
Feminine side since the day that I died
While I whittle my bones until I'm brittle
Am I pretty now
For some reason I find myself
Lost in what you think of me
And too confused to choose who I should be
And now you've got me thinking
I wish I could be a girl, and that way
You'd wish I could be your girlfriend, boyfriend
Am I pretty enough to lie to
I wish I could be a girl, and that way
You'd wish I could be your girlfriend, boyfriend
Just little old me in a big, big world
Little old me in a big world
I wish I were a girl
I've been feeling lighthearted
Since I gained enough weight back to cover my bones
I get dressed up in shadows one leg at a time
We're so alike
But if the shoe fits, then I won't try it on
You'll be walking out early, but the show must go on
No, I know that I'm wrong
But I love how you're on my side when I cross that line
It's been a point of contention between myself and this
Body that they stuck me in
The privilege of being born to be a man
And now you got me thinking
I wish I could be a girl, and that way
You'd wish I could be your girlfriend, boyfriend
Am I pretty enough to lie to
I wish I could be a girl, and that way
You'd wish I could be your girlfriend, boyfriend
Just little old me in a big, big world
Little old me in a big world
I wish
Eating your prosthetic meat/meet your anesthetic criteria
Pathetic seeing you be copacetic/come acetic
Say my name like a slur, but I've been called worse
And I've heard it all before, no this isn't a first
Let me be the void you fill with
Taxidermy fingerprints, taxonomize our differences
I am quantum physics
My witness brings me into existence
I wish I could be a girl, and that way
You'd wish I could be your girlfriend, boyfriend
Am I pretty enough to love back
No not yet
I wish I could be a girl, and really
I'd prefer it if you would use I / Me / Myself
Am I pretty enough, am I pretty enough
To fucking die
Little old me in a big world
Well I would give you my whole world
Little old me in a big world
I wish...

SECOND SIGHT SEER:

My grip on my secrets slipping while I'm speaking in tongues
Screaming at the top of my lungs in the confession booth
Take it with a pillar of salt, H.A.L.T., it's not my fault
The devil made me do it, but I also kinda wanted to
I'm cut from a different kind of meat
More than you can chew, hard to swallow me
Forget bored stiff, I got rigor mortis, call it morbid curiosity how I
Cannot commit to reality, when my third eye's open and I like what I see
Baby, I may be crazy but I didn't lose it, no I set it free
I can't ignore what's under dance floorboards
The rhythm of my heart a dead-as-disco beat
But I still move my feet to slip out of this groove, I'm free
Now, to row, row, row my boat over the falls
And maybe wake up from but a dream, yeah
I'm just a psycho, babe. Come and go out my mind
I didn't lose it babe, there wasn't much to find
I'm just a psycho, babe. Come and go out my mind
I'm only passing through
If you knew what I knew, if you saw what I see
You'd look through illusions, hallucinations, and lucid dream
And I know that meaning can be such a pretty thing to keep
But I got facts and I'm not afraid to use 'em
Take the good with the bad, take off the back you make a new front
Some days I'm glad that I am a madman and I'd rather be that than
An amicable animal, mild-mannered cannibal
But I'm more level-headed and clever than ever
And I'm getting better one forever at a time, and if
Sick is defined by what's different, well then pull the plug out and let me die
Vice-versa vice versus virtue, well who I am I choose through all the things I do
And if it rhymes, it's true. But I hate poetry
Now with my moral compass pointing south, going down
With no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no respect for reality
I'm just a psycho, babe. Come and go out my mind
I didn't lose it babe, there wasn't much to find
I'm just a psycho, babe. Come and go out my mind
I'm only passing through
I'm just a psycho, babe. Come and go out my mind
I didn't lose it babe, there wasn't much to find
I'm just a psycho, babe. Come and go out my mind
A tourist passing through
Well that was fun, goodbye

LAPLACE'S ANGEL:

Have you ever died in a nightmare?
Woke up surprised you hadn't earned your fate?
Have you ever felt like Atlas, threw your back out on the axis
And collapsed and threw the planet away?
Everyone's just blood in an ice tray
A vampire picking flowers out in the sun
Run your diagnostic tests, it's posited nobody dies agnostic
But we still dial 9-1-1
And now we're singing
Ooh, could you take a look at me? (It's the norm for animals, it's the norm for chemicals)
Am I bad, am I bad, am I bad, am I really that bad? (It's the norm for particles, eye for eye for tooth)
And now we're singing, ooh (it's the norm for chemicals)
Whatever you think of me (it's the norm for particles)
If you were in my shoes (yes, it's only natural)
You'd walk the same damn miles I do
We're only tuning to the tone of the bell curve now
Ask not for whom it tolls
But with my head up in the clouds I can see so much ground
And from up here, you look like ants in a row
It doesn't take a killer to murder
It only takes a reason to kill
We've all got evidence of innocence, it's "everything's coincidence"
The difference twixt fate and free will is whether you're singing
Ooh, could you take a look at me? (It's the norm for animals, it's the norm for chemicals)
Am I bad, am I bad, am I bad, am I really that bad? (It's the norm for particles, I for I for tooth)
And now we're singing, ooh (it's the norm for chemicals)
Whatever you think of me (it's the norm for particles)
If you were in my shoes (yes, it's only natural!)
You'd walk the same damn miles I do
Oh, oh, right!
So if you wash your hands of where you've been until you flood the second floor
Neatly fold your skeletons, but still can't shut the closet door
The only ones in need of love are those who don't receive enough
So evil ones should get a little more
You, could you take a look at me? (You could break an angel's fall and ignore the Devil's call)
Am I bad, am I bad, am I bad, am I really that bad? (Still forsaken shoulders fall silent now)
And now we're singing, ooh (it's no more than cultural)
Whatever you think of me (you and me inseparable)
If the shoe fits, would you walk that mile? (It's a small hell, after all)
You could put it on the other foot, it's the same size
You, could you take a look at me? (Man no more than animal is made of moral chemicals)
Am I bad, am I bad, am I bad, am I really that bad? (Any form mechanical, thank you, God)
We're singing, ooh (from the hordes of cannibals)
Whatever you think of me (to psych wards of hospitals)
If you were in my shoes (it's a small world, after all)
You'd see I wear the same size as you
Oh, oh, right!

OAK AND ASH AND THORN:

Of all the trees that grow so fair, old England to adorn
Greater are none beneath the sun than Oak, and Ash, and Thorn
Sing Oak, and Ash, and Thorn, good sirs
All on a midsummer's morn
Surely we'll sing of no little thing
In Oak, and Ash, and Thorn
Yew that is old, in churchyard mould, he breedeth a mighty bow
Alder for shoes do wise men choose, and Beech for cups also
But when you have killed
And your bowl it is filled, and your shoes are clean outworn
Back you must speed for all that you need to Oak, and Ash, and Thorn
Sing Oak, and Ash, and Thorn, good sirs
All on a midsummer's morn
Surely we'll sing of no little thing
In Oak, and Ash, and Thorn
Sing Oak, and Ash, and Thorn, good sirs
All on a midsummer's morn
Surely we'll sing of no little thing
In Oak, and Ash, and Thorn
Elm, she hates mankind and waits, 'til every gust be laid
To drop a limb on the head of him that anyway trusts her shade
But whether a lad be sober or sad, or mellow with ale from the horn
He'll take no wrong when he lyeth along 'neath Oak, and Ash, and Thorn
Sing Oak, and Ash, and Thorn, good sirs
All on a midsummer's morn
Surely we'll sing of no little thing
In Oak, and Ash, and Thorn
Sing Oak, and Ash, and Thorn, good sirs
All on a midsummer's morn
Surely we'll sing of no little thing
In Oak, and Ash, and Thorn
Oh, do not tell the priest our plight
For he would call it a sin
But we've been out in the woods all night, a-conjuring summer in
We bring you good news by word of mouth, good news for cattle and corn
Sure as the sun come up from the south, by Oak, and Ash, and Thorn
Sing Oak, and Ash, and Thorn, good sirs
All on a midsummer's morn
Surely we'll sing of no little thing
In Oak, and Ash, and Thorn
Sing Oak, and Ash, and Thorn, good sirs
All on a midsummer's morn
Surely we'll sing of no little thing
In Oak, and Ash, and Thorn
Sing Oak, and Ash, and Thorn, good sirs
All on a midsummer's morn
Surely we'll sing of no little thing
In Oak, and Ash, and Thorn
Sing Oak, and Ash, and Thorn, good sirs
All on a midsummer's morn
Surely we'll sing of no little thing
In Oak, and Ash, and Thorn

HERE'S A HEALTH TO THE COMPANY:

Kind friends and companions, come join me in rhyme
Come lift up your voices in chorus with mine
Come lift up your voices all grief to refrain
For we may or might never all meet here again
Here's a health to the company and one to my lass
Let us drink and be merry all out of one glass
Let us drink and be merry all grief to refrain
For we may or might never all meet here again
Here's a health to the dear lass that I love so well
For her style and her beauty, sure none can excel
There's a smile on her countenance as she sits on my knee
There's no man in this wide world as happy as me
Here's a health to the company and one to my lass
Let us drink and be merry all out of one glass
Let us drink and be merry all grief to refrain
For we may or might never all meet here again
Our ship lies at anchor, she's ready to dock
I wish her safe landing, without any shock
If ever I should meet you by land or by sea
I will always remember your kindness to me
Here's a health to the company and one to my lass
Let us drink and be merry all out of one glass
Let us drink and be merry all grief to refrain
For we may or might never all meet here again
Here's a health to the company and one to my lass
Let us drink and be merry all out of one glass
Let us drink and be merry all grief to refrain
For we may or might never all meet here again

BONES IN THE OCEAN:

Oh, I bid farewell to the port and the land
And I paddle away from brave England's white sands
To search for my long ago forgotten friends
To search for the place I hear all sailors end
As the souls of the dead fill the space of my mind
I'll search without sleeping 'til peace I can find
I fear not the weather, I fear not the sea
I remember the fallen, do they think of me?
When their bones in the ocean forever will be
Plot a course to the night to a place I once knew
To a place where my hope died along with my crew
So I swallow my grief and face life's final test
To find promise of peace and the solace of rest
As the songs of the dead fill the space of my ears
Their laughter like children, their beckoning cheers
My heart longs to join them, sing songs of the sea
I remember the fallen, do they think of me?
When their bones in the ocean forever will be
When at last before my ghostly shipmates I stand
I shed a small tear for my home upon land
Though their eyes speak of depths filled with struggle and strife
Their smiles below say I don't owe them my life
As the souls of the dead fill the space of my eyes
And my boat listed over and tried to capsize
I'm this far from drowning, this far from the sea
I remember the living, do they think of me?
When my bones in the ocean forever will be
Now that I'm staring down at the darkest abyss
I'm not sure what I want, but I don't think it's this
As my comrades call to stand fast and forge on
I make sail for the dawn 'til the darkness has gone
As the souls of the dead live for'er in my mind
As I live all the years that they left me behind
I'll stay on the shore but still gaze at the sea
I remember the fallen and they think of me
For our souls in the ocean together will be
I remember the fallen and they think of me
For our souls in the ocean together will be
